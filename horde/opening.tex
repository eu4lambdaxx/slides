  Most of the strategies here are presented through Oirat. Thus, this doubles as
  an optimized Oirat guide. Nevertheless, I try to explain the high level
  explanations behind any Oirat-specific concepts and provide alternate
  solutions for other hordes. That being said, if anyone wants to attempt a pre
  1600 WC, I would highly recommend either Oirat or Kazan.
