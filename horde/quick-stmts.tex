  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``You should only raze when\ldots''
    \begin{itemize}
      \item You should ALWAYS raze.
    \end{itemize}
    \item ``You should use X cav.''
    \begin{itemize}
      \item You should never use cav beyond the starting ones\footnote{Do note
          that gnostek uses cav a lot. I personally disagree, and I'm under the
          impression that marco/accordion don't use cav either. Gnostek's
          playstyle gives him way more ducats to work with than usual, and I
          think just outright banning cav is the most beginner friendly way.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item ``You can't WC before 1600 without cheats.''
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Unless you define razing or culture flipping as cheating, I hope you
        stay tuned. Hordes are OP.
